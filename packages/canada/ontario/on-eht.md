# Ontario — Employer Health Tax (EHT) — Skill v1.0

The Ontario Employer Health Tax (EHT) is a payroll-based tax levied under the *Employer Health Tax Act*, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.11, administered by the Ontario Ministry of Finance. It applies to employers with permanent establishments in Ontario, in addition to any federal CPP/EI obligations covered by **canada-payroll**. This skill MUST be read alongside canada-payroll whenever Ontario payroll is in scope.

## 1. Quick reference

| Item | 2025 value |
|---|---|
| Exemption (private-sector eligible employers) | **$1,000,000** of Ontario remuneration |
| Top rate (payroll > $400,000) | **1.95%** |
| Bottom rate (payroll ≤ $200,000, not exempt) | **0.98%** |
| Sliding scale band | $200,001 – $400,000 (rate 0.98% → 1.95%) |
| Registration / filing threshold | Total Ontario payroll > **$200,000** in the year, OR EHT payable for the year |
| Annual return | **Form 6076E** — due **March 15** following tax year |
| Monthly instalment trigger | Prior-year EHT > **$600** |

> **Two-step calculation:** (1) subtract any allocated $1M exemption from total Ontario remuneration; (2) apply the rate from the bracket that the **total** (pre-exemption) payroll falls into to the **remuneration after exemption**.

---

## 2. Required inputs + refusal catalogue

### Required inputs
- Legal name, Ontario EHT account number (1234-5678-RT0001 style not used; EHT has its own 7-digit account).
- Total **Ontario remuneration** paid in the calendar year (gross wages, salaries, bonuses, taxable benefits, commissions, vacation pay, stock-option benefits, director's fees attributable to Ontario service).
- Whether the employer is part of an **associated group** under s. 1(2) of the EHT Act (and the associated-employer Exemption Allocation Agreement, Form ON00150E).
- Sector classification (private, public, charitable, multi-account charitable).
- Prior-year EHT (to determine monthly-instalment requirement).
- Number of months of operation in the year (for proration in start-up / wind-up / short-year cases).

### Refusal catalogue
Refuse and escalate if the engagement involves:
- **R-ON-EHT-1** Public-sector or quasi-public-sector employers (no $1M exemption; complex grant-funded payroll rules).
- **R-ON-EHT-2** Multi-account charitable employers with more than one qualifying campus (s. 2.1 EHT Act, separate per-campus exemption mechanics).
- **R-ON-EHT-3** Voluntary disclosure or arrears settlement (Ontario Voluntary Disclosures Program).
- **R-ON-EHT-4** Associated-employer disputes where the s. 256 ITA association test is contested.
- **R-ON-EHT-5** Stock option benefit timing disputes (s. 1(1) "remuneration" — Ontario follows federal timing under s. 7 ITA, but disputes go to the Minister, not us).
- **R-ON-EHT-6** Special purpose entities — partnerships of corporations, joint ventures with separate Ontario PE, non-resident employers with intermittent Ontario presence.
- **R-ON-EHT-7** Out-of-scope: WSIB premiums (separate regime — see §10).

---

## 3. Rate

The EHT rate is **not flat**. It is a graduated scale based on **total Ontario remuneration** (pre-exemption):

| Total Ontario remuneration (pre-exemption) | Rate applied to remuneration after exemption |
|---|---|
| Up to $200,000 | 0.98% |
| $200,000.01 – $230,000 | 1.101% |
| $230,000.01 – $260,000 | 1.223% |
| $260,000.01 – $290,000 | 1.344% |
| $290,000.01 – $320,000 | 1.465% |
| $320,000.01 – $350,000 | 1.586% |
| $350,000.01 – $380,000 | 1.708% |
| $380,000.01 – $400,000 | 1.829% |
| Over $400,000 | 1.95% |

The sliding band between $200k and $400k is constructed so the marginal rate climbs roughly linearly from 0.98% to 1.95%.

## 4. Exemption

**Eligible private-sector employers** receive an annual exemption of **$1,000,000** of Ontario remuneration. This was raised from $490,000 in March 2020 and remains at $1M for the 2025 tax year.

**Eligibility for the exemption:**
- Private-sector employer (corporations, partnerships, sole proprietors with employees).
- **Not** a public-sector employer listed in s. 1 of the Act (Crown agencies, municipalities, school boards, hospitals, public colleges/universities — these get **no** exemption).
- Total annual Ontario payroll of an associated group **≤ $5,000,000** (the $5M cap was introduced in 2014 — if combined associated-group payroll exceeds $5M, **the entire group loses the exemption** for that year, except for registered charities).
- Registered charities are **not subject to the $5M cap** and always receive the exemption (and may have multiple-account treatment under s. 2.1).

**Associated employers must share** the $1M exemption pursuant to s. 2.2 of the Act. They file **Form ON00150E — Associated Employers Exemption Allocation** to allocate the exemption among themselves. Each associated employer that does not allocate exemption to itself is fully taxable on its Ontario remuneration with no exemption.

**Proration:** the exemption is prorated for short years (employer started or ceased operations partway through the year): exemption × (months of operation ÷ 12). A partial month counts as a full month.

---

## 5. Liability threshold — who must register and file

An employer **must register** for an EHT account if:
- Total Ontario remuneration exceeds the **$1,000,000 exemption** for the year (private sector), OR
- Total Ontario remuneration exceeds **$200,000** for the year and the employer is **not eligible** for the exemption (public sector, associated group over $5M, etc.), OR
- The employer is required to remit EHT on Ontario remuneration that exceeds its allocated share of the exemption.

**No filing required** if Ontario remuneration ≤ $1M for a sole eligible private-sector employer with no associated employers — but **best practice is still to register** if approaching the threshold, because retroactive registration triggers penalties.

**Public sector** and **associated employers over the $5M cap**: must register and file once Ontario payroll exceeds **$200,000** (no exemption — the $200k figure here is the registration floor, not an exemption).

---

## 6. Annual return — Form 6076E

The annual return is **Form 6076E — Employer Health Tax Annual Return**, due **March 15** of the year following the tax year (e.g., 2025 tax year → due **March 15, 2026**).

The return reconciles total Ontario remuneration, applies the exemption (and associated-group allocation), computes EHT at the correct graduated rate, and credits any monthly instalments paid during the year. Net balance owing is due **March 15**; refunds are issued by the Ministry of Finance.

**Filing channels:**
- ONT-TAXS online (preferred — most employers).
- Paper Form 6076E mailed to Ministry of Finance, 33 King Street West, Oshawa ON L1H 8H5.

**Late filing penalty:** 5% of unpaid tax plus 1% per month for up to 12 months, plus interest at the prescribed rate.

---

## 7. Instalments

If the employer's **prior-year EHT** exceeded **$600**, monthly instalments are required for the current year. Instalments are due the **15th day of the month following** the month in which remuneration was paid (e.g., January payroll → February 15 instalment).

Each monthly instalment is computed by applying the appropriate rate to the **Ontario remuneration paid that month**, after deducting the **monthly portion of the exemption** ($1,000,000 ÷ 12 = $83,333.33 per month for a full-year private-sector employer with no associated allocations).

Employers with prior-year EHT ≤ $600 pay annually with the Form 6076E filing.

**Final reconciliation:** the March 15 annual return either tops up underpayment or claims refund of overpayment.

---

## 8. Special situations

**Registered charities (s. 2.1).** Charities receive the $1M exemption per **qualifying campus** (a separate physical location with payroll). Multi-campus charities can multiply their exemption. They are exempt from the $5M associated-group cap.

**Seasonal employers.** Operate only part of the year; exemption is **not** prorated for seasonal operation if the employer existed throughout the year (e.g., a ski resort with a 5-month payroll season still gets the full $1M exemption). The exemption is **only** prorated when the employer's existence (not its activity) is shorter than 12 months.

**Multi-employer associated groups.** Under s. 256 ITA association rules (applied via s. 1(2) EHT Act). One Exemption Allocation Agreement (Form ON00150E) per group. If unallocated, **no employer in the group gets exemption**. Group's combined Ontario payroll determines the $5M cap test.

**Non-resident employers.** Liable for EHT on remuneration paid to employees who report for work at a **permanent establishment in Ontario**, or who are paid from an Ontario PE. A non-resident with no Ontario PE may still trigger EHT if the employee spends substantially all working time in Ontario (s. 1(2) deeming rules).

**Mid-year start-up or wind-up.** Exemption prorated by months of existence. A business that started July 1 has 6 months of existence → exemption = $1,000,000 × 6/12 = $500,000.

**Stock option benefits.** Treated as Ontario remuneration in the year the s. 7 ITA benefit is included in employment income. Sourced to Ontario based on where employment services were performed during the option's vesting period.

## 9. Worked example — Toronto tech startup

**Facts:**
- "AcmeDev Inc." — Ontario CCPC, single Ontario PE in downtown Toronto.
- 12 employees, all in Toronto, paid evenly throughout 2025.
- Total 2025 Ontario remuneration: **$1,500,000** (salaries $1,380,000 + taxable benefits $90,000 + bonuses $30,000).
- No associated employers, no public-sector involvement.
- Prior-year (2024) EHT: $4,800 → monthly instalments required.

**Step 1 — Confirm exemption eligibility.**
Private-sector, no associated group, payroll < $5M → eligible for **$1,000,000 exemption**.

**Step 2 — Determine bracket.**
Total Ontario remuneration = $1,500,000. This is **over $400,000**, so the applicable rate is **1.95%** on remuneration after exemption.

**Step 3 — Compute taxable remuneration.**
$1,500,000 − $1,000,000 exemption = **$500,000** taxable.

**Step 4 — Compute EHT.**
$500,000 × 1.95% = **$9,750.00** annual EHT.

**Step 5 — Monthly instalments during 2025.**
Each month: $125,000 paid (1.5M ÷ 12), monthly exemption portion = $83,333.33.
Taxable per month = $125,000 − $83,333.33 = $41,666.67.
EHT per month = $41,666.67 × 1.95% = **$812.50**.
12 × $812.50 = $9,750 ✓ ties to annual.

**Step 6 — Annual return.**
Form 6076E filed by **March 15, 2026**. Total EHT $9,750; instalments paid $9,750; balance owing **$0**.

**Reviewer cross-check:** AcmeDev's federal T4 summary should show $1,500,000 in Box 14 totals across all T4s issued for Ontario employees, matching the Ontario remuneration figure on Form 6076E within a typical reconciling-item tolerance (taxable benefits not on T4 Box 14, etc.). Flag any variance > 2% for review.

## 10. Coordination with WSIB

**WSIB (Workplace Safety and Insurance Board)** premiums are a **separate Ontario regime** under the *Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997* — **not** part of EHT. Key distinctions:

| | EHT | WSIB |
|---|---|---|
| Statute | EHT Act, R.S.O. 1990 | WSI Act, S.O. 1997 |
| Administered by | Ministry of Finance | WSIB (Crown agency) |
| Base | Total Ontario remuneration | Insurable earnings (capped) |
| 2025 max insurable earnings (WSIB) | n/a — uncapped | $117,000 per worker |
| Rate | 0.98% – 1.95% (graduated) | Industry classification rate (varies — see WSIB rate schedule) |
| Coverage required? | All Ontario payrolls (over threshold) | Schedule 1 and 2 industries; some industries optional |
| Filing | Form 6076E annually | Monthly/quarterly reconciliation + annual reconciliation |

**Out of scope** for this skill — WSIB has its own classification, premium-rate, and reconciliation framework. If the engagement requires WSIB compliance, escalate to a dedicated Ontario payroll specialist or the WSIB Employer Account Services line.

**Coordination note:** EHT and WSIB use **different definitions of "remuneration"**. EHT includes taxable benefits, stock-option benefits, and bonuses; WSIB excludes amounts over the max insurable earnings cap and excludes certain benefits. Never assume one figure satisfies both.

## 11. Conservative defaults

When inputs are ambiguous, apply the following defaults:

1. **Assume not exempt** until private-sector status and $5M associated-group cap are confirmed in writing.
2. **Apply the top rate (1.95%)** when total Ontario remuneration is unknown but clearly over $400,000.
3. **Treat all Ontario-paid employees as Ontario-resident for EHT purposes** unless evidence of out-of-province work performance is documented.
4. **Include all taxable benefits, bonuses, vacation pay, commissions, and stock-option benefits** in remuneration. Exclude only items explicitly excluded under s. 1(1) of the Act (e.g., reimbursements of business expenses).
5. **Assume monthly instalments are required** if prior-year EHT cannot be confirmed. Setting up monthly instalments mid-year is much cheaper than catching up late.
6. **Register early.** If approaching $1M payroll, register before crossing the threshold to avoid retroactive penalties.
7. **For associated groups, allocate exemption to the highest-payroll member first** unless tax planning suggests otherwise (the allocation is binding for the year once filed — get sign-off from the group's tax advisor before submitting Form ON00150E).
8. **March 15 is a hard deadline.** Late filing penalty starts immediately; do not assume any administrative grace period.
9. **Reconcile EHT remuneration to T4 Box 14 totals** as a final review step; document any variance.
10. **Refer all WSIB questions out.** EHT scope only.
