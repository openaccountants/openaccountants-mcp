# Ireland — PAYE (Pay-As-You-Earn) — Skill v1.0

> **2025 changes summary (v1.0):** PAYE Modernisation has been live since **1 January 2019** and remains the operating framework for 2025 — employers submit payroll data to Revenue **on or before each payment** via the **Revenue Online Service (ROS)**. The standard rate cut-off point for a single individual is **EUR 44,000** for 2025 (up from EUR 42,000 in 2024) under Finance Act 2024. The Personal Tax Credit and PAYE Tax Credit each rise to **EUR 2,000** for 2025. The **Small Benefit Exemption** is **EUR 1,000 per year** across up to **two non-cash benefits** (Finance Act 2024). PRSI Class A employee rate rises to **4.1%** from 1 October 2024 per the Roadmap for Increased PRSI Rates 2024–2028, and employer rates also step up. USC bands and rates are out of scope here — see `ie-usc`. The **P30** monthly return and **P35** annual return are abolished — payroll data is in real time, and payment is due by the **23rd of the following month** via ROS Debit Instruction or ROS Bank Transfer.

## Section 3 — Tier 1: Calculating PAYE under PAYE Modernisation real-time reporting

> **Bands, credits, USC and PRSI:** This skill assumes the 2025 standard rate cut-off points, the 2025 tax credit schedule, USC bands (from `ie-usc`) and the PRSI Class A schedule. Always load `ie-usc` alongside this skill. This section focuses on the **payroll mechanics**: how the RPN drives the cumulative computation and how data flows through a real-time payroll submission.

### 3.1 The PAYE Modernisation cycle (since 1 January 2019)

```
Step 0  Register employee on ROS → triggers Revenue to issue an RPN
Step 1  Pull RPN from ROS before each pay run (employer or payroll software)
Step 2  Compute gross pay, BIK notional pay, and pre-tax deductions
Step 3  Apply tax credits and SRCOP from RPN on the basis indicated
         (cumulative / week 1 / emergency)
Step 4  Compute PAYE, USC, PRSI and LPT (Local Property Tax, if deduction at source)
Step 5  Pay employee net
Step 6  Submit payroll data (PSR — Payroll Submission Request) to ROS
         ON OR BEFORE the payment date
Step 7  Revenue issues a statement of liability on the 5th of the following month
Step 8  Pay the consolidated PAYE/USC/PRSI/LPT to Revenue by the 23rd
         of the following month (ROS Debit Instruction)
```

### 3.2 Cumulative basis — the default

The cumulative basis is the **default** for an employee with a current RPN. Tax is computed on **year-to-date (YTD)** pay, against **YTD tax credits** and **YTD standard rate band**, then the YTD PAYE already deducted is subtracted to give this period's PAYE.

```
For each pay period (cumulative basis):

  YTD_gross_taxable = Σ(gross + notional BIK − pension − PHI − approved deductions)
  YTD_credits       = (Annual tax credits ÷ pay periods in year) × period number
  YTD_SRCOP         = (Annual SRCOP ÷ pay periods in year) × period number

  YTD_tax_at_standard = min(YTD_gross_taxable, YTD_SRCOP) × 20%
  YTD_tax_at_higher   = max(YTD_gross_taxable − YTD_SRCOP, 0) × 40%
  YTD_gross_tax       = YTD_tax_at_standard + YTD_tax_at_higher

  YTD_PAYE_liability  = max(YTD_gross_tax − YTD_credits, 0)

  This_period_PAYE    = YTD_PAYE_liability − Σ(prior periods' PAYE)
```

> **Negative result:** If `This_period_PAYE` is negative (e.g. credits restored, employee returned from unpaid leave), a **refund** is due via payroll. Employer may offset against the same period's PAYE remittance to Revenue.

### 3.3 Week 1 / Month 1 basis — non-cumulative

Used when:
- Employee starts mid-year with no prior P45-equivalent / no leaver RPN data,
- Employee requests it (e.g. variable second employment),
- Revenue specifies it on the RPN.

```
For each pay period (week 1 / month 1):

  Period_gross_taxable = gross + notional BIK − pension − PHI
  Period_SRCOP         = Annual SRCOP ÷ pay periods in year
  Period_credits       = Annual credits ÷ pay periods in year

  Period_tax_at_standard = min(Period_gross_taxable, Period_SRCOP) × 20%
  Period_tax_at_higher   = max(Period_gross_taxable − Period_SRCOP, 0) × 40%
  Period_gross_tax       = Period_tax_at_standard + Period_tax_at_higher

  This_period_PAYE       = max(Period_gross_tax − Period_credits, 0)
```

No YTD reconciliation within the year; year-end true-up via Form 12 / Statement of Liability.

### 3.4 RPN lifecycle

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| New hire | Register employment on ROS → Revenue issues RPN within 2 working days |
| Pre-payroll | Pull latest RPN from ROS for **every** employee before running payroll |
| Mid-year RPN change | Revenue may issue a fresh RPN (e.g. tax credit reallocation between spouses, new credit claim) — apply from next pay date |
| No RPN available | Operate **emergency tax basis** (see §4.1) |
| Employee ceases | Mark cessation date on next PSR; final RPN reflects leaver status |
| Employee on multiple employments | Each employment has its own RPN with its own credits / SRCOP split |

### 3.5 Payroll Submission Request (PSR) data items (per pay line)

- Employee PPS number
- Employment ID
- Pay frequency
- Pay date
- Gross pay (taxable + non-taxable separately)
- Notional pay (BIK)
- Pension contributions (employee + employer separately)
- PAYE deducted
- USC deducted
- PRSI deducted (employee + employer)
- LPT deducted at source (where Revenue has instructed)
- Share-based remuneration (RTSO1 separately for unapproved options)
- Cessation date (if applicable)

Submit via ROS web upload, ROS API, or integrated payroll software.

## Section 4 — Tier 2: Emergency tax, week 1 basis, BIK, Small Benefit Exemption

### 4.1 Emergency tax basis

Triggered when:
- Employer cannot retrieve an RPN (employee has not provided PPSN, or Revenue has no record),
- Employee has no PPSN at all.

**Where employee has provided PPSN but no RPN yet:**

| Pay period | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Weeks 1–4 (or month 1) | Standard rate band of **1/52 (or 1/12) of EUR 44,000** applied at 20%; **no tax credits** |
| Weeks 5–8 | Standard rate band **halved**; no credits |
| Week 9 onwards | **All pay taxed at 40%**; no SRCOP; no credits |

**Where employee has not provided PPSN:**

All pay taxed at **40%** from week/month 1; no SRCOP; no credits.

USC under emergency basis: applied at **8% flat** (no exemptions).

When RPN arrives: switch basis on next pay run; if cumulative, the YTD computation will refund any over-deduction.

### 4.2 Week 1 / Month 1 basis — when and why

Use this basis when Revenue specifies it on the RPN, or:
- New hire mid-year with no prior PAYE data,
- Employee with a previously volatile pay pattern (Revenue's call),
- Employer requested by employee with multiple jobs to avoid over-claiming credits on one.

Mechanics in §3.3. No YTD true-up within the year — over/under-deductions are squared at year-end through the Statement of Liability or Form 12.

### 4.3 Benefit-in-Kind (BIK)

BIK is **notional pay** — added to gross taxable pay for PAYE, USC and PRSI purposes.

| BIK category | 2025 valuation rule |
|---|---|
| Company car (combustion engine) | Annual taxable benefit = OMV × percentage based on annual business km and CO2 emissions category (Category A: lowest CO2 → 22.5% to 37.5%; Category E: highest CO2 → 30% to 37.5%). Tapered by business kilometres. |
| Company car — Electric (EV) | Reduced regime: OMV reduced by **EUR 35,000** for 2025 before applying the percentage; further reductions phase out through 2027 |
| Company car — Plug-in hybrid | Standard CO2 category basis; no EV reduction |
| Company van | **8% of OMV** (electric vans: reduced rate same as EV cars regime applies through 2025) |
| Employer-provided accommodation | **8% of market value** of the property OR rent paid by employer, whichever is higher |
| Preferential loans (qualifying home loan) | **Specified rate 4%** less interest paid; difference is BIK |
| Preferential loans (other) | **Specified rate 13.5%** less interest paid; difference is BIK |
| Medical insurance paid by employer | Gross premium (employer is the gross-up source); employee claims **20% tax relief** at source (TRS) — employer applies this at payroll |
| Employer-provided childcare | Not BIK if exempt criteria met (workplace nursery in TCA 1997 s.120A); otherwise full cost |
| Shares awarded (unapproved) | Market value at vesting/award; share schemes have separate RTSO1 mechanism for unapproved options |

BIK is included in **gross pay** in the PSR each pay period — apportion the annual BIK figure across pay periods.

### 4.4 Small Benefit Exemption

- **EUR 1,000 per year** (Finance Act 2024, up from EUR 500 in 2022 and EUR 1,000 effective 2024).
- Up to **two non-cash benefits** per year per employee.
- Must be **non-cash** — typical vehicle is a **One4all** voucher or similar gift card.
- Cannot be exchanged for cash.
- Cannot be part of a salary sacrifice arrangement.
- If the limit is exceeded by even EUR 1, the **entire** benefit becomes taxable (no partial relief).
- Excludes meal vouchers, share-based remuneration, and employer pension contributions.

When the exemption applies, the benefit is **not** included in PAYE / USC / PRSI — but it is **still reported** on the PSR.

### 4.5 Illness Benefit (Department of Social Protection)

- Illness Benefit paid by DSP is **taxable** but **not subject to USC or PRSI**.
- Revenue notifies the employer via RPN; employer adds the gross Illness Benefit to taxable pay (not gross pay).
- DSP pays the employee directly; employer does not pay it.

### 4.6 Pension contributions

- Employee occupational pension / PRSA contributions are **deductible from gross pay before PAYE** subject to the **age-related limits** (15% under 30 → 40% over 60) and the **earnings cap of EUR 115,000**.
- USC and PRSI are computed on the **pre-pension** gross — pensions do **not** reduce USC or PRSI base.
- Employer contributions are **not BIK** in the employee's hands.

---

## Section 5 — Worked example

**Scenario:** Single PAYE employee, monthly payroll, no prior employment in 2025. Monthly gross EUR 5,000. No BIK. Pension contribution 5% of gross (within age-related limit). RPN issued on cumulative basis with full Personal Tax Credit + PAYE Tax Credit + EUR 44,000 SRCOP. October 2025 pay period (period 10 of 12).

### A — Annual reference values from RPN

| Item | EUR |
|---|---|
| Annual SRCOP | 44,000 |
| Annual tax credits (Personal 2,000 + PAYE 2,000) | 4,000 |
| Pay periods in year | 12 |
| Monthly SRCOP | 3,666.67 |
| Monthly tax credits | 333.33 |

### B — October period gross & deductions

| Item | EUR |
|---|---|
| Monthly gross | 5,000.00 |
| − Pension (5%) | (250.00) |
| **Taxable pay (this period)** | **4,750.00** |

### C — YTD figures (cumulative basis, period 10)

| Item | EUR |
|---|---|
| YTD taxable pay (10 × 4,750) | 47,500.00 |
| YTD SRCOP (10 × 3,666.67) | 36,666.67 |
| YTD tax credits (10 × 333.33) | 3,333.33 |

### D — YTD PAYE computation

```
YTD tax at standard rate = min(47,500.00 , 36,666.67) × 20%
                         = 36,666.67 × 20%
                         = 7,333.33

YTD tax at higher rate   = max(47,500.00 − 36,666.67 , 0) × 40%
                         = 10,833.33 × 40%
                         = 4,333.33

YTD gross tax            = 7,333.33 + 4,333.33 = 11,666.66

YTD PAYE liability       = 11,666.66 − 3,333.33 = 8,333.33
```

### E — This-period PAYE (assuming prior 9 months deducted EUR 7,500 cumulatively)

```
This period PAYE = 8,333.33 − 7,500.00 = 833.33
```

(In a steady-state monthly run with consistent pay, monthly PAYE settles at ~EUR 833.33 = annual EUR 10,000 ÷ 12.)

### F — USC and PRSI (delegated)

- **USC** on EUR 5,000 monthly gross (pre-pension) → see `ie-usc` for band application. Indicative: EUR 5,000 × 12 = EUR 60,000 annual → top band at 8% engages; monthly USC roughly EUR 250–300.
- **PRSI Class A employee** at 4.1% of EUR 5,000 = **EUR 205.00**.

### G — Net pay (this period)

| Component | EUR |
|---|---|
| Gross pay | 5,000.00 |
| − Pension (5%) | (250.00) |
| − PAYE | (833.33) |
| − USC (indicative, see `ie-usc`) | (~265.00) |
| − PRSI employee (4.1%) | (205.00) |
| **Net pay** | **~3,446.67** |

### H — Employer cost (this period)

| Component | EUR |
|---|---|
| Gross pay | 5,000.00 |
| Employer PRSI Class A (11.15% above EUR 496/wk threshold) | 557.50 |
| Employer pension (if applicable) | (per policy) |
| **Direct employer cost (excl. employer pension)** | **5,557.50** |

### I — PSR submission

On or before pay date (e.g. 31 October 2025), submit PSR to ROS with employee details, gross 5,000, notional pay 0, pension 250, PAYE 833.33, USC ~265.00, PRSI employee 205, PRSI employer 557.50.

### J — Payment to Revenue

By **23 November 2025**, pay the consolidated October liability:
- PAYE: 833.33
- USC: ~265.00
- PRSI (employee + employer): 762.50
- **Total: ~EUR 1,860.83**

Via ROS Debit Instruction.

---

## Section 6 — Filing & payment

### Real-time monthly cycle

| Step | Action | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Retrieve RPN for each employee from ROS | Before each pay run |
| 2 | Compute gross, BIK, deductions, PAYE/USC/PRSI/LPT per Section 3 | Before pay date |
| 3 | Pay employee net | Per company schedule |
| 4 | Submit **Payroll Submission Request (PSR)** to ROS | **On or before the pay date** |
| 5 | Revenue issues monthly **statement** on the 5th of the following month | n/a (auto) |
| 6 | Review statement; raise correction if needed (correction PSR) | By 14th of following month |
| 7 | Pay consolidated PAYE/USC/PRSI/LPT to Revenue | **23rd of the following month** (ROS Debit Instruction) |

### What happened to P30 and P35?

- **P30** (monthly/quarterly return) — **abolished** with PAYE Modernisation effective 1 January 2019. Replaced by real-time PSRs and the monthly Revenue-generated statement.
- **P35** (annual reconciliation) — **abolished**. No annual employer return; the year's data is the sum of in-year PSRs.
- **P45** (cessation certificate) — **abolished**. Cessation is reported on the PSR.
- **P60** (year-end employee certificate) — **abolished**. Employees access their year-end statement via **myAccount** on Revenue's website.
- **P2C** (paper tax credit certificate to employer) — **abolished**. Replaced by the digital RPN pulled in real time.

### Choosing reduced filing — small employers

Employers with annual PAYE/USC/PRSI < **EUR 28,800** (combined) may apply to Revenue for **quarterly** payment (still monthly PSRs, just quarterly payment). Standard threshold; verify on ROS.

### Penalties

| Default | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Late PSR submission | EUR 4,000 per offence under TCA 1997 s.987 (typically waived for occasional lateness on first offence; flag if pattern) |
| Failure to operate PAYE / under-deduction | Tax + interest at **0.0219% per day** (~8% p.a.) + s.987 penalty |
| Late payment | Interest at 0.0219% per day; Revenue may also apply a surcharge |
| Failure to register as employer | EUR 4,000 + back-tax |
| Incorrect RPN application (e.g. ignoring week-1 instruction) | Penalty + interest on under-deduction |
| Failure to issue cessation on PSR | EUR 4,000 |

### Employee year-end (informational)

- Revenue auto-generates a **Statement of Liability** (formerly P21) via myAccount around January.
- Employees with **non-PAYE income** (rental, foreign, share options exercised, > EUR 5,000 non-PAYE income) must file **Form 11** by 31 October following the tax year (paper) or extended via ROS — see `ie-income-tax-form11`.
- Employees with PAYE-only income but a one-off adjustment (medical expenses, rent credit, working-from-home relief) file **Form 12** via myAccount.

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

When inputs are incomplete or ambiguous, default to the most cautious position and flag for reviewer:

| Situation | Conservative position |
|---|---|
| No RPN available; PPSN provided | Operate **emergency tax basis** per §4.1 — do not assume cumulative credits. Pull RPN on next pay run and refund any over-deduction via cumulative computation |
| No PPSN at all | Operate emergency basis at **40% flat**, no SRCOP, no credits; require employee to obtain PPSN via DEASP — block onboarding completion until PPSN provided |
| Pay frequency mid-year change | Adjust period number and divisor; re-cut SRCOP and credits on the new frequency from the change date |
| Mid-year joiner with no prior employment data | Default to **week 1 basis** until prior YTD figures confirmed via RPN; switch to cumulative once RPN refreshes |
| BIK valuation uncertain (company car CO2 category, business km estimate) | Use **highest reasonable percentage** in the matrix and pro-rate business km **conservatively low**; flag for reviewer with year-end true-up |
| Small Benefit Exemption near limit | Track running total per employee; if a second benefit would exceed EUR 1,000, **tax the full second benefit** rather than risk wiping the exemption |
| Pension contribution above age-related limit | Cap the **deductible** portion; excess is contributed but not pre-PAYE — flag for reviewer |
| Employee with two employments | Default to **week 1 basis** on the secondary employment unless Revenue's RPN explicitly splits credits / SRCOP between them |
| Proprietary director (>50% shareholder) misclassified as Class A | Default to **PRSI Class S** (self-employed) — Class A is not available; flag for reviewer |
| Termination payment | Treat as fully taxable PAYE unless statutory redundancy + SCSB documented; flag for reviewer if amount > EUR 50,000 |
| Illness Benefit not on RPN | Do not include in payroll until Revenue notifies via RPN; do not estimate |
| Share-based remuneration (RSUs vesting) | Apply PAYE on market value at vesting; flag share-options (unapproved) for separate **RTSO1** within 30 days of exercise |
| Cessation mid-period | Issue final cumulative payroll with cessation date on PSR; do not back-date or pre-date |
