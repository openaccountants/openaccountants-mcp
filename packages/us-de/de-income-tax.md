## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Starting point:** Delaware begins with federal adjusted gross income (AGI) from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

### Key additions to Delaware income
- Interest on state/local obligations of other states (not Delaware or federal)
- Fiduciary adjustments

### Key subtractions from Delaware income
- Social Security benefits (fully excluded — Delaware does not tax Social Security)
- Pension/retirement income exclusion: up to $12,500 for taxpayers age 60+ (per person)
- Taxable Social Security already excluded above
- Delaware state tax refund included in federal AGI
- Certain disability income exclusions
- Qualified dividends/capital gains exclusion for taxpayers age 60+ (within the $12,500 limit)

### Net result
Federal AGI ± Delaware modifications = Delaware adjusted gross income → minus standard or itemized deduction = Delaware taxable income → apply rate table → subtract personal credits.

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### QBI conformity
Delaware starts from federal AGI. The federal QBI deduction (§199A) is below the AGI line and does NOT affect Delaware's starting point. Delaware does not separately allow or disallow QBI.

### SE health insurance deduction
Already reflected in federal AGI (Form 1040, Schedule 1, Line 17). Flows through to Delaware automatically.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, solo 401(k))
Already reflected in federal AGI. No Delaware add-back required.

### Home office deduction
Already reflected in Schedule C → federal AGI. Flows through automatically.

### Estimated tax (Form PIT-EST)
Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe $400 or more. Voucher due dates: April 30, June 15, September 15, January 15.

### Gross Receipts Tax interaction
Delaware sole proprietors are also subject to the Delaware Gross Receipts Tax on business revenue. See `de-gross-receipts-tax.md`. The GRT paid is a deductible business expense on federal Schedule C, reducing federal AGI and therefore Delaware taxable income.

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| DE-IT-1.01 | Delaware taxable income = Delaware AGI minus standard (or itemized) deduction |
| DE-IT-1.02 | If taxable income < $60,000, use tax table; if ≥ $60,000, use tax rate schedule |
| DE-IT-1.03 | Personal credits ($110 each) reduce tax dollar-for-dollar (non-refundable) |
| DE-IT-1.04 | First $2,000 of taxable income is taxed at 0% |

| DE-IT-1.08 | Earned Income Tax Credit: 4.5% of federal EITC (non-refundable) |

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Rule | Judgment needed |
|---|---|---|
| DE-IT-2.01 | Standard vs. itemized deduction election | Delaware allows itemization independently of federal choice; compare amounts |
| DE-IT-2.02 | Wilmington earned income tax interaction | City of Wilmington imposes separate earned income tax (1.25%); not part of state return but affects total tax burden |
| DE-IT-2.03 | Multi-state income allocation | If taxpayer earned income in other states, credit for taxes paid to other states may apply |
| DE-IT-2.04 | Business vs. investment income characterization | Affects whether gross receipts tax applies |
| DE-IT-2.05 | 2026+ bracket changes | Monitor whether HS 2 for HB 13 is enacted; if so, 2026 returns need new rate schedule |
