## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-PT-F1 -- Skipping the Contabilista Certificado.** "Every Portuguese company must have a Contabilista Certificado (CC) appointed. This is a legal requirement, not optional. The CC is personally liable for the accuracy of tax declarations."

**R-PT-F2 -- Not depositing capital on time.** "Capital must be deposited within 5 working days of Empresa na Hora formation, or delivered to company coffers by end of first financial year. Failure can result in personal liability for gerentes."

**R-PT-F3 -- Non-resident without fiscal representative.** "Non-EU/EEA residents must appoint a fiscal representative in Portugal before obtaining a NIF. Without a NIF, no corporate formation is possible."

**R-PT-F4 -- Shell company for Golden Visa.** "Company formation alone does not qualify for the Golden Visa. The investment must meet specific criteria (fund investment, job creation, etc.) as per the 2023 reform. Do not advise formation as a visa pathway without specialist immigration advice."

**R-PT-F5 -- RCBE non-compliance.** "Failure to file and annually confirm the beneficial ownership register (RCBE) results in the company being unable to enter into contracts, receive funds, or distribute profits."
