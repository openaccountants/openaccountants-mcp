### IRS Tax Brackets (2026)

| Bracket | Taxable Income (€) | Marginal Rate | Parcela a Abater |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 – 8,342 | 12.5% | €0 |
| 2 | 8,342 – 12,587 | 15.7% | €266.94 |
| 3 | 12,587 – 17,838 | 21.2% | €959.23 |
| 4 | 17,838 – 23,089 | 24.1% | €1,476.53 |
| 5 | 23,089 – 29,397 | 31.1% | €3,092.76 |
| 6 | 29,397 – 43,090 | 34.9% | €4,209.85 |
| 7 | 43,090 – 46,566 | 43.1% | €7,743.23 |

| 9 | Above 86,634 | 48.0% | €11,387.28 |

**Solidarity surtax (taxa adicional de solidariedade, Art 68.º-A CIRS):** 2.5% on taxable income €80,000–€250,000; 5% above €250,000.

**Mínimo de Existência (2026):** €12,880 — ensures no taxpayer's net income after tax falls below this floor.

## Section 2 — Income Splitting & Structuring

### Sole Trader (Empresário em Nome Individual) vs Company (Sociedade)

**Sole trader / freelancer (trabalhador independente):** income reported as Category B on Modelo 3. Two sub-regimes:

1. **Simplified regime (regime simplificado):** gross receipts ≤€200,000. Taxable income = gross × coefficient (e.g., 0.75 for professional services listed in Art 151.º CIRS; 0.35 for other services; 0.15 for goods sales). You cannot deduct additional expenses on top of the coefficient — it is a package deal. Must justify 15% of gross as business expenses (faturas with NIF).

2. **Organized accounts (contabilidade organizada):** mandatory if gross >€200,000, optional below. Deduct actual business expenses. Requires certified accountant (TOC/CC). More beneficial when actual expenses significantly exceed the implied coefficient deduction.

**Company (Sociedade Unipessoal, Lda or SA):** IRC at 21% (17% on first €50,000 for PMEs). Profits distributed as dividends taxed at 28% autonomous rate or included in IRS at progressive rates (50% exclusion for resident shareholders — tributação englobamento). Administrative burden higher.

**Decision rule:** simplified regime is typically optimal for freelancers with low actual expenses (the coefficient implies 25%+ expenses automatically). Switch to organized accounts when documented expenses exceed the coefficient allowance. Consider incorporation when profit consistently exceeds ~€60,000–€80,000.

### Joint Taxation (Tributação Conjunta)

Married couples or civil partners can opt for joint taxation. Taxable income is halved, tax computed on half, then doubled. Beneficial when incomes are significantly unequal — pulls the higher earner down into a lower bracket.

### IFICI / NHR 2.0

The original NHR program (Residente Não Habitual) closed to new applicants 1 January 2024. Existing NHR holders retain benefits for 10 years. Replacement: IFICI (Incentivo Fiscal à Investigação Científica e Inovação) — 20% flat rate on qualifying Portuguese employment/self-employment income for up to 10 years. Strictly limited to researchers, scientists, qualified professionals in innovation, and specific investment-related roles. Most freelancers do NOT qualify.

## Section 3 — Deductions Most People Miss

### Personal Deductions (Deduções à Coleta) — Art 78.º CIRS

| Category | Deduction | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| General family (despesas gerais familiares) | 35% of expenses with NIF | €250/taxpayer (€500 couple) |
| Health (saúde) | 15% of health expenses (IVA 6% or exempt) | €1,000 |
| Education (educação) | 30% of education expenses | €800 |
| Housing (habitação) | 15% of rent or mortgage interest | €502 (rent) / €296 (interest) |
| Care homes (lares) | 25% of expenses | €403.75 |
| Alimony (pensão de alimentos) | 20% of court-ordered payments | No cap |
| VAT invoices (IVA/fatura) | 15% of IVA on restaurants, hairdressers, auto repairs, vets, gyms, etc. | €250 (from e-fatura) |
| Donations | Various | Up to 15% of coleta |

### Category B Specific Deductions (Organized Accounts)

Under organized accounts, deduct actual business expenses: office rent, equipment, professional services, travel, training, telecommunications, insurance, and depreciation. Subject to wholly-and-exclusively test.

### Simplified Regime — The 15% Justification Rule

For coefficients 0.75 and 0.35, you must justify expenses equal to 15% of gross receipts. If not fully justified, the shortfall is added to taxable income. Sources of justification:
- **Specific deduction:** €4,587.09 automatically applied (or total social security contributions if higher, up to 10% of gross)
- **Business-related invoices** with your NIF (utilities, telecoms, professional services, travel, etc.)
- **IMI (property tax)** and mortgage interest on business property

**Planning tip:** always request NIF on all business-related purchases. The gap between ¥4,587.09 and 15% of gross is the amount you must evidence via invoices.

---

## Section 4 — Capital Allowances Optimization

### Depreciation (Amortizações) — Organized Accounts

Depreciation follows Decreto Regulamentar n.º 25/2009 rates:

| Asset Category | Rate |
|---|---|
| Buildings (commercial) | 2%–5% |
| Office furniture | 12.5% |
| Computer hardware | 33.33% |
| Software | 33.33% |
| Motor vehicles (passenger) | 25% |
| Plant and machinery | 10%–20% |

Motor vehicle depreciation limited to vehicles costing ≤€62,500 (electric vehicles) or ≤€37,500 (other). Excess cost non-depreciable.

### Simplified Regime

No explicit depreciation claims — the coefficient subsumes all expenses. Asset purchases do not create additional deductions.

### Reinvestment Relief (IRC — Companies)

Reinvestment of capital gains from fixed assets into new qualifying assets within the reinvestment period: 50% of the gain excluded from taxation (Art 48.º CIRC). Planning opportunity when selling business premises or equipment.

---

## Section 5 — Loss Utilization

### Category B Losses (Self-Employed)

Under organized accounts, Category B losses can offset other Category B income in the same year and carry forward for 12 years (Art 55.º CIRS). Losses under the simplified regime are NOT generated — the coefficient methodology always produces positive taxable income.

**Key restriction:** Category B losses cannot offset other income categories (Category A employment, Category E capital income, etc.) — only other Category B income.

### IRC (Companies)

Tax losses carry forward for 12 years. Can offset up to 65% of taxable profit in each subsequent year (Art 52.º CIRC). Subject to maintaining >50% ownership continuity.

### Capital Losses (Category G)

Capital losses on securities carry forward 5 years against capital gains only (Art 55.º, n.º 5 CIRS). Property losses can offset property gains.

---

## Section 6 — Timing Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Advance IRS payments (pagamentos por conta) | Self-employed with prior-year IRS >€301 must make 3 advance payments (July, September, December). If income drops, request reduction (Art 107.º CIRS) |
| Defer invoicing to January | If under simplified regime and close to €200,000 threshold, timing matters. Also shifts income to next tax year |
| Accelerate expenses before year-end | Under organized accounts: purchase equipment, prepay services, pay outstanding invoices before 31 December |
| E-fatura collection | Ensure all NIF invoices are validated on Portal das Finanças by mid-February (deadline for corrections). Maximise IVA deduction and despesas gerais |
| Joint vs separate taxation | Model both scenarios annually. Especially beneficial when one spouse has no/low income |
| Social security base update | Quarterly declaration updates the contribution base. If income drops, declare promptly to reduce quarterly SS payments |
| Capital gains deferral | Reinvest property sale proceeds into new primary residence within 36 months (Art 10.º, n.º 5 CIRS) to exclude the gain |

---

## Section 7 — IVA (VAT) Optimization

| Topic | Detail |
|---|---|
| Exemption threshold | Turnover ≤€14,500 (2026): exempt from IVA under Art 53.º CIVA. No IVA charged, no input credit. Review annually as threshold may change |
| Registration above threshold | Mandatory registration and quarterly IVA returns. Can recover IVA on business purchases |
| Simplified IVA regime | No separate simplified regime beyond Art 53 exemption. Small businesses use regular regime above threshold |
| Rates | 23% standard (mainland); 13% intermediate; 6% reduced. Azores: 16%/9%/4%. Madeira: 22%/12%/5% |
| Input credit planning | Under organized accounts, claim full IVA on business expenses. Mixed-use items: pro-rata method (pro rata de dedução) |
| IVA on cross-border services | B2B intra-EU services: reverse charge applies (Art 6.º, n.º 6a CIVA). No Portuguese IVA charged; client self-assesses in their country. Register for VIES |
| Recapitulative statement | Quarterly EU sales listing (declaração recapitulativa) if providing intra-EU services |

---

## Section 8 — Social Security Optimization

### Self-Employed Contributions (Trabalhadores Independentes)

- **Rate:** 21.4% on the relevant base (rendimento relevante)
- **Relevant base calculation:** quarterly, based on gross receipts from the prior quarter × coefficient (typically 70% for services, 20% for goods)
- **Annual cap:** 12 × IAS (Indexante dos Apoios Sociais). IAS 2026 = €522.50 → cap ~€75,240/year
- **Quarterly payments:** January, April, July, October

### Exemptions and Reductions

| Situation | Treatment |
|---|---|
| First 12 months of activity | Full exemption (first-time self-employed only) |
| Months 13–24 | 50% reduction |
| Cumulative employment + self-employment | If employed with SS contributions and self-employment income <4× IAS (~€2,090/month), may be exempt from self-employment SS |
| Spouse of sole trader | If genuinely employed in the business, can be registered as employee with employer contributions |

### Optimization Strategies

- **Low early income:** benefit from 12-month exemption + 12-month 50% reduction = 2 years of reduced SS
- **Dual employment + freelance:** maintain employment contract to potentially exempt freelance income from SS contributions
- **Voluntary higher contributions:** generally not advantageous — benefits (pension) are modest relative to additional cost. Focus on private retirement savings (PPR)
- **PPR (Plano Poupança Reforma):** investment in approved retirement plan → IRS deduction of 20% of contributions up to €400 (under 35), €350 (35–50), €300 (50+). Per person.

## Section 9 — Investment & Retirement

| Instrument | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| PPR (Plano Poupança Reforma) | 20% IRS deduction on contributions (age-dependent cap). Early withdrawal penalty outside qualifying events. Gains taxed at 8% (after 8+ years) |
| Savings deposits interest | 28% autonomous rate or optional englobamento (progressive rates). Englobamento beneficial if marginal rate <28% |
| Dividends (Portuguese companies) | 28% autonomous rate. If englobamento elected, only 50% included in taxable income (effective max 24%) |
| Capital gains — securities | 28% autonomous rate on net gains. Englobamento optional. Losses offset gains in same year and carry forward 5 years |
| Capital gains — property | 50% of net gain included in taxable income (progressive rates). Reinvestment exclusion for primary residence within 36 months (Art 10.º, n.º 5 CIRS) |
| Rental income (Category F) | 28% autonomous rate or englobamento. Deductible expenses: IMI, condo fees, insurance, maintenance, property management. Depreciation at 2% for buildings |
| Crypto assets | 28% on gains from crypto held <365 days. Exempt if held ≥365 days (Art 10.º, n.º 17 CIRS) |

### Englobamento Strategy

Electing englobamento (inclusion in progressive IRS bands) can reduce tax on investment income if your marginal rate is below 28%. However, englobamento is all-or-nothing for each income category — you cannot cherry-pick individual items. Model carefully before electing.

### Primary Residence Reinvestment

Net capital gain from selling primary residence is excluded from taxation if proceeds are reinvested in a new primary residence (EU/EEA) within 36 months after sale or 24 months before. Partial reinvestment → partial exclusion.

---

## Section 10 — Red Lines (GAAR & Scrutiny Triggers)

### GAAR (Cláusula Geral Anti-Abuso)

Art 38.º, n.º 2 da Lei Geral Tributária (LGT). AT can disregard or recharacterise arrangements that are artificial, lack economic substance, and are primarily motivated by tax avoidance. Requires prior approval from the Centro de Estudos Fiscais.

### AT Scrutiny Triggers

| Trigger | Risk |
|---|---|
| Income mismatch with e-fatura data | AT cross-references invoices issued with income declared. Automatic flagging |
| Simplified regime with income near €200,000 | AT checks for income splitting across multiple NIFs/activities |
| Failing to justify 15% expenses (simplified regime) | Shortfall added to taxable income automatically |
| Dual activity — undeclared services | AT monitors bank account deposits vs declared receipts |
| False recibos verdes (dependent employment disguised as freelance) | Employer fined; worker reclassified. ACT (labour inspectorate) and AT coordinate |
| Property transactions below VPT (Valor Patrimonial Tributário) | AT applies higher of sale price or VPT for capital gains and IMT |
| Offshore structures without substance | CFC rules (Art 66.º CIRC) and reporting obligations |
| Social security contributions avoidance | Segurança Social cross-checks AT data. Penalties + back contributions |
| Large IVA refund claims | Manual review and audit |

### Absolute Prohibitions

- NEVER advise issuing recibos verdes for work that is genuinely dependent employment
- NEVER advise underreporting income when invoices are tracked via e-fatura
- NEVER advise declaring property sales below VPT
- NEVER advise artificial income splitting to stay below the €200,000 simplified regime threshold
- NEVER advise failing to register for IVA when above the exemption threshold
- NEVER advise avoiding social security registration when legally required

## Section 11 — Annual Tax Planning Calendar

| When | Action |
|---|---|
| January | Quarterly SS contribution due. First advance IRS payment opportunity. Review e-fatura for prior year — begin corrections |
| February | E-fatura validation deadline (typically mid-February). Ensure all NIF invoices are correctly categorised |
| March | Deadline to communicate household composition (agregado familiar) to AT. Confirm IRS deductions on Portal das Finanças |
| April | IRS filing period opens (1 April). Early filing for straightforward returns. Review joint vs separate taxation |
| May | Continue IRS filing. Quarterly SS contribution due (April). Model tax for the year |
| June 30 | IRS filing deadline. Ensure Modelo 3 submitted. File Anexo B (Category B), Anexo H (deductions), Anexo J (foreign income) |
| July | First pagamento por conta (advance IRS) due. Review SS base for next quarter. |
| September | Second pagamento por conta due. Mid-year tax review |
| October | Quarterly SS contribution due. Review investment income for englobamento decision |
| November | Plan year-end PPR contributions. Review property transactions for reinvestment timelines |
| December | Third pagamento por conta due. **Critical month:** make PPR contributions, charitable donations. Ensure all business invoices with NIF are issued. Final SS contribution of the year. Deadline for IVA regime elections |

## Section 12 — Cash Impact Examples

### Example 1 — Simplified vs Organized Accounts (Freelancer)

**Freelancer (Art 151 professional), gross receipts €50,000. Actual expenses: €8,000.**

**Simplified regime:** Taxable = €50,000 × 0.75 = €37,500 (assuming 15% expenses justified). IRS: €37,500 × 34.9% – €4,209.85 (bracket 6) = €8,877.65. Plus SS: 21.4% × (€50,000 × 0.70 / 3 × 12 months basis) ≈ €7,490. **Total tax + SS: ~€16,368.**

**Organized accounts:** Taxable = €50,000 – €8,000 = €42,000. IRS: €42,000 × 34.9% – €4,209.85 = €10,448.15. SS: same ~€7,490. Plus accountant fees ~€1,500. **Total: ~€19,438.**

**Simplified regime saves ~€3,070.** Organized accounts only win if actual expenses >€12,500 (25% of gross).

### Example 2 — Joint vs Separate Taxation

**Couple: Spouse A earns €60,000, Spouse B earns €10,000.**

**Separate:** A: IRS ~€14,527. B: IRS ~€460. Total: ~€14,987.

**Joint:** Combined €70,000 ÷ 2 = €35,000 each. IRS per half: ~€8,012 × 2 = ~€16,024. **Separate filing saves ~€1,037** in this case.

**If Spouse B earns €0:** Joint: €60,000 ÷ 2 = €30,000 each. IRS: ~€6,215 × 2 = €12,430. Separate: €14,527. **Joint saves ~€2,097.**

### Example 3 — Crypto Held Over 365 Days

**Bought BTC for €10,000 in January 2025. Sold for €25,000 in March 2026 (>365 days held).**

Tax: **€0** — capital gains on crypto held ≥365 days are exempt (Art 10.º, n.º 17 CIRS).

If sold within 365 days: (€25,000 – €10,000) × 28% = €4,200 tax.

### Example 4 — Primary Residence Reinvestment

Sell primary residence for €300,000 (purchased at €200,000). Gain: €100,000. 50% included = €50,000 taxable at marginal rate (~34.9%) = €13,341.

Reinvest full €300,000 in new primary residence within 36 months: **€0 tax.** Partial reinvestment (€200,000 of €300,000 = 66.7%): 66.7% excluded → tax on 33.3% × €50,000 = ~€4,450.
