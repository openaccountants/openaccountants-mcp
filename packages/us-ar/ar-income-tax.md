## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rates (TY 2025)

**Regular Tax Table — All filing statuses (net taxable income ≤ $92,300):**

| Net taxable income | Rate |
|---|---|
| $0 – $5,499 | 0% |
| $5,500 – $10,899 | 2.0% |
| $10,900 – $15,599 | 3.0% |
| $15,600 – $25,699 | 3.4% |
| $25,700 – $92,300 | 3.9% |

**High-income table (net taxable income > $92,300):**

| Net taxable income | Rate |
|---|---|
| $0 – $4,600 | 2.0% |
| $4,601 and above | 3.9% |

The top marginal rate of **3.9%** applies for TY 2025 (reduced from 4.4% by Act 1 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2024).

### Standard deduction (TY 2025)

| Filing status | Standard deduction |
|---|---|
| Single (Status 1) | $2,410 |
| Married Filing Jointly (Status 2) | $4,820 |
| Married Filing Separately (Status 4/5) | $2,410 |
| Head of Household (Status 3) | $2,410 |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse (Status 6) | $2,410 |

### Personal tax credit

| Credit | Amount |
|---|---|

**Special note:** Residents of Texarkana, Arkansas are fully exempt from Arkansas individual income taxes.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

1. **Starting point:** Arkansas begins with **federal adjusted gross income** (from federal Form 1040, Line 11).
2. **Arkansas adjustments (Form AR1000ADJ):** Add back or subtract items per Arkansas law.
3. **Arkansas additions:** Income not included federally but taxable in AR (e.g., certain exempt interest from other states).
4. **Arkansas subtractions:** Income included federally but exempt in AR (e.g., first $6,000 of retirement income for taxpayers 59½+, active-duty military income, U.S. obligation interest).
5. **Deductions:** Subtract standard deduction or Arkansas itemized deductions.
6. **Result:** Net taxable income → apply graduated rates from tax table.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Federal conformity
- Arkansas generally conforms to the IRC for computing income, including Schedule C business deductions.
- Arkansas adopts most above-the-line deductions that reduce federal AGI.

### QBI deduction (§199A)
- The federal QBI deduction is taken below the line on the federal return and does **not** affect federal AGI. Therefore, it does not flow into Arkansas's starting point. Arkansas does not have its own QBI equivalent deduction.

### SE health insurance deduction
- Flows through federal AGI (above-the-line deduction on federal Form 1040) and is automatically reflected in Arkansas's starting point.

### Retirement contributions
- SEP-IRA and Solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI and therefore reduce Arkansas starting income.
- Arkansas provides an additional subtraction for up to $6,000 of retirement income received (age 59½+).

### Home office deduction
- Federal home office deduction flows through Schedule C and is reflected in federal AGI.

### Estimated tax payments
- **Threshold:** Must pay estimated tax if you expect to owe tax after withholding and credits (Arkansas follows federal estimated tax principles).
- **Due dates:** April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
- **Payment methods:** Via ATAP (Arkansas Taxpayer Access Point) online portal or by mail with Form AR1000ES.
- **Safe harbor:** Pay 90% of current year liability or 100% of prior year liability.

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| # | Rule | Why judgment needed |
|---|---|---|
| T2-01 | Standard deduction vs. itemized | Taxpayer must compare; both spouses must use same method |
| T2-02 | Regular vs. low-income tax table | Low-income table incorporates standard deduction — cannot also claim separately |
| T2-03 | Part-year resident allocation | Requires Form AR1000NR and income sourcing analysis |
| T2-04 | Credit for taxes paid to other states | Requires documentation of income taxed elsewhere |
| T2-05 | Business vs. hobby determination | Same federal analysis, but affects AR Schedule C flow-through |
| T2-06 | Timing of income recognition | Arkansas may differ from federal for certain items |
